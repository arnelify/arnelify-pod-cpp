| **Option**|**Description**|
|-|-|
| **SERVER_ALLOW_EMPTY_FILES**| If this option is enabled, the server will not reject empty files.|
| **SERVER_BLOCK_SIZE_KB**| The size of the allocated memory used for processing large packets.|
| **SERVER_CHARSET**| Defines the encoding that the server will recommend to all client applications.|
| **SERVER_GZIP**| If this option is enabled, the server will use GZIP compression if the client application supports it. This setting increases CPU resource consumption. The server will not use compression if the data size exceeds the value of **SERVER_BLOCK_SIZE_KB**.|
| **SERVER_KEEP_EXTENSIONS**| If this option is enabled, file extensions will be preserved.|
| **SERVER_MAX_FIELDS**| Defines the maximum number of fields in the received form.|
| **SERVER_MAX_FIELDS_SIZE_TOTAL_MB**| Defines the maximum total size of all fields in the form. This option does not include file sizes.|
| **SERVER_MAX_FILES**| Defines the maximum number of files in the form.|
| **SERVER_MAX_FILES_SIZE_TOTAL_MB** | Defines the maximum total size of all files in the form.|
| **SERVER_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB**| Defines the maximum size of a single file in the form.|
| **SERVER_PORT**| Defines which port the server will listen on.|
